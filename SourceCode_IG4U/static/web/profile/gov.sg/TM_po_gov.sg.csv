The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine was transported on Singapore Airlines flight SQ7979, which departed on Sunday 20 December from Brussels, and landed at Singapore Changi Airport at 7.36pm on Monday.

The vaccines were packed in thermal shipper boxes filled with dry ice designed to keep the vials at -70 degree Celsius.

Upon arrival, ground handler SATS moved the vaccines to its cold chain facility. They were then loaded onto a refrigerated truck that would send them to an external storage facility with capabilities to handle ultra-cold storage at about -80 degree Celsius.

Staff and logistics partners have been trained up to WHO standards to be able to handle the cargo safely.

"“It’s been almost a year since I became a swabber, and the most fulfilling part about my job is when I’m able to put a smile on my clients’ face. I try to make the swabbing process as smooth as possible, because I know that some of them might feel anxious.

A year ago, I’d never imagine myself in such a role. I was looking forward to an internship programme overseas after graduating with a Psychology degree. But these plans changed because of the pandemic. After getting over the disappointment, I started looking for jobs but found it to be an uphill task: many companies were either holding back on hiring or retrenching their staff. 

One day, I came across a job opening to be a swabber with the Health Promotion Board. My dad, who has been in the healthcare sector for more than four decades, encouraged me to try it out. I applied for the role, knowing that it would also be a chance to step up and make a difference during a national crisis. 

Despite the training I received, I can still remember how nervous I was at the start. Was I using the correct technique? What if I hurt someone during the process? I slowly gained confidence thanks to my supervisor and parents. Although my mother was slightly worried about my safety at first, my father encouraged me to step outside of my comfort zone and pick up a new skill. It was his encouragement that gave me the push and confidence to take on the role. I wanted to give my best every day and felt a strong sense of achievement and satisfaction, especially when members of public showed appreciation for our work on the frontlines.

My team members come from different walks of life but we are united by a shared mission to contribute to Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. The camaraderie among us is very strong – this is something I’ll treasure for a long time.”

"“I really miss interacting freely with passengers and my fellow colleagues. Life has not been the same since. There were many days where I have felt discouraged. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the transport industry tremendously. During Circuit Breaker, our ridership went down quite a bit. We also had to intensify various safety precautions for our passengers, such as disinfecting high-touch points and sanitising our buses twice a day.

That’s why I was happy to hear about the COVID-19 vaccines. I believe that the vaccine will protect myself, my loved ones and my passengers.

I was one of the first Bus Captains to sign up for the vaccination. I chose to go for the first available slot to instill confidence and encourage my fellow colleagues and union members to do the same. As a frontliner, it is also my duty to protect myself so I can protect the passengers I meet daily.

All of us have a role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Even though there is a small chance that a vaccinated person can still get infected, the risk of them falling very sick is greatly reduced! We should all take the vaccination to protect ourselves and those around us!”

A biopsy also found that I had a rare skin cancer. It was very early stage cancer, so thankfully, I didn’t have to go through chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Through surgery, the doctors managed to remove the tumour in my colon.

When I was offered the COVID-19 vaccine, I said, ‘Sure, why not!’. The cancer was in remission so there were no issues taking the vaccine.

I’ve also been taking blood thinning medications for Chronic Venous Insufficiency, enlarged prostate glands and an irregular heartbeat. To make sure I could take the vaccines, I checked with the doctor at the vaccination centre, who gave me the go-ahead to do so.

The morning after my first jab, I felt well enough to go for my 3km brisk walk. I didn’t experience any issues with my second jab too.

My friends ask me if I’ve done my jab. Some say they prefer to wait and see. I assured one of them, ‘You are only 80 years old! My jogging kakis are 86 and 90 and they went through the jab with no issues! We are living examples.’

We always say that early diagnosis is the best treatment for cancer. The chance of recovery is higher. Likewise, for COVID-19 - if there is a way to prevent it, why not?""

"""When I became a nurse, I pledged to serve and protect my patients, those entrusted into my care. This is why I stepped forward to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it was my turn.

As a Nurse Manager, I am in frequent contact with many elderly residents of the home. They are at a higher risk of serious illness if they contract the virus. Taking the vaccine will not only protect myself, but also my residents and staff of the home.

When I first heard about the vaccine, I was quite concerned as I have asthma and was not sure if I could take the vaccine.

– Shanti Devi, 49, Nurse Manager for Red Cross Home for the Disabled #IGotMyShotSG #SGPerspectives",#IGotMyShotSG #SGPerspectives,,,en,"""When I became a nurse, I pledged to serve and protect my patients, those entrusted into my care. This is why I stepped forward to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it was my turn.

As a Nurse Manager, I am in frequent contact with many elderly residents of the home. They are at a higher risk of serious illness if they contract the virus. Taking the vaccine will not only protect myself, but also my residents and staff of the home.

When I first heard about the vaccine, I was quite concerned as I have asthma and was not sure if I could take the vaccine. However, my fears were quickly dispelled as I was encouraged by my colleagues who had taken the vaccine. I have also been encouraging my elderly residents to get vaccinated, if they are medically eligible.

As more of us get vaccinated, the closer we get to living in the new normal while being socially responsible by keeping up with safe management measures. Do take the shot if you can. Getting vaccinated will protect you and your loved ones.""

"“I was quite surprised when I tested positive. I didn’t feel any COVID-19 symptoms like fever, runny nose, or cough. 

Recovery at home was like a normal day life for me. After a couple days, you get used to it. Home Recovery is definitely a better idea for those who have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Since I didn’t have any symptoms, I didn’t want to overwhelm the healthcare system.

"“This pandemic has changed our lives drastically and almost everything we do here at PCF Sparkletots. While some semblance of normalcy was restored, things are not as they were before.

This was one of my motivations to get vaccinated.

As the Executive Principal of the preschool centre, I’m in frequent contact with my staff, parents and students. I know that I’ve a social responsibility to protect those around me, especially the children who cannot be vaccinated. All of us have the responsibility to protect those who cannot take the vaccine due to age or certain medical conditions.

Even though I was a little apprehensive about taking the COVID-19 vaccine due to my hypertension, my fears were alleviated after I consulted with my doctor. He assured me that the vaccines were safe, which gave me the extra resolve to put my foot forward.

If someone tells me that they will ‘wait and see’ before taking the vaccine, I will ask them ‘Why wait and see, when you can take it now to protect yourself and your loved ones?’ If you are medically fit, take the COVID-19 vaccine. If not for yourself, do it for your loved ones.”

As the Executive Principal of the preschool centre, Im in frequent contact with my staff, parents and students. I know that Ive a social responsibility to protect those around me, especially the children who cannot be vaccinated. All of us have the responsibility to protect those who cannot take the vaccine due to age or certain medical conditions.

Even though I was a little apprehensive about taking the COVID-19 vaccine due to my hypertension, my fears were alleviated after I consulted with my doctor. He assured me that the vaccines were safe, which gave me the extra resolve to put my foot forward.

If someone tells me that they will wait and see before taking the vaccine, I will ask them Why wait and see, when you can take it now to protect yourself and your loved ones? If you are medically fit, take the COVID-19 vaccine. If not for yourself, do it for your loved ones.

 Kathryn Goy, 54, Executive Principal of PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) Fellow

"“I’ve always suffered from frequent and chronic coughs. When the first COVID-19 vaccine was approved in Singapore, I had just been discharged from the hospital after recuperating from a lung infection.

Even then, I knew that I had to take the vaccine when it was offered to me. As I had existing health problems, my family was very worried about potential long-term side effects, and repeatedly asked me if I was sure about my decision.

Although I had some worries at the start, I asked myself, ‘Why am I afraid? I am doing this for my health, and for my family’s health. If I get COVID-19, my family may get it as well. I want to do it for them.’

As a healthcare worker, I also wanted to set a good example to show my patients that COVID-19 vaccines are safe. I knew that before I could take care of patients, I had to first take care of myself. When I informed the nurse at the vaccination centre of my medical conditions, she assured me that I was medically fit to take the vaccine.

After the vaccination, I only had mild side effects from the second dose which were easily and quickly managed. Having been assured through my experience, my family members also decided to get vaccinated. My husband, who has hypertension, just completed both doses of the vaccine. 

Protect yourself, and your loved ones. I got my shot, get yours too!”

"""We met at the Singapore Buddhist Mission and first joined the Buddhist Youth Network (BYN) through an annual youth leadership camp that aimed to build spiritual friendships. 

Since then, we have worked closely with BYN to develop community programmes and provide a platform for young Buddhists to connect with Buddhist leaders locally and abroad. These included the inaugural Buddhist Mentorship Programme which helped participants reconnect with their faith and learn how to apply their beliefs. An International Women’s Day event was also organised to celebrate empowered and nurturing Buddhist women, raising $1,088 in proceeds for local Buddhist monastics who are elderly or living alone. 

One of our most memorable community service projects was the #OneMettaApart campaign in 2020 which encouraged the practice of Metta, meaning Loving-Kindness, to all walks of life. This led to another initiative - “The Great Metta Sit”. Held last year, it saw 1,000 people gathering virtually to meditate and promote unconditional love, regardless of race, language or religion. We believed this was timely as so many people had been affected by the pandemic. $1 was pledged for every minute of meditation to Buddhist non-profit organisations Firefly Mission and Aranya Sangha Dana Fellowship Limited, raising a total of $15,000. 

We’re currently preparing for an upcoming concert called #MusicforMetta. With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, we’re excited to share a star-studded line-up, which includes an award-winning flautist, homegrown singers and music producers to celebrate Vesak Day with inspiring music, lyrics and energy. 

We’re also looking forward to celebrating it with our spiritual and lay teachers, family, and friends who have supported us over the years and to express our heartfelt gratitude. This Vesak Day, we hope for an abundance of peace in the heart, joy of loving-kindness and growing wisdom.""

"""When I first started collecting and distributing unsold bread, it never crossed my mind that this one-man initiative would grow into the community we have today. 

The Giving Collective started with a simple idea to reduce food waste. Back in 2019, I was passing by a bakery on my way home from work when I saw all the leftover bread they had. It made no sense to me to let the food go to waste. Many of the elderly I knew from volunteering at a Senior Activity Centre would appreciate receiving the unsold bread. 

Today, our volunteers distribute unsold food collected from bakery outlets across Singapore. Many who come to collect the bread are elderly people who live alone and prefer not to cook. We don’t believe in turning people away. After all, our goal is to share resources and reduce waste. The only thing we moderate is how much bread each person can take for food safety reasons. Bread shouldn’t be kept for too many days. 

The best part of what we do is the community spirit of neighbours helping each other. Occasionally, we would get other types of food donations such as unsold noodles. Someone would volunteer to cook and share the noodles with others. Others would collect the food on behalf of their wheelchair-bound neighbours. I hope we can champion the reduction of food waste further. For instance, by setting up more community fridges or food sharing programmes. 

I believe we should look at sustainability with a 'pay it forward' mentality. When we look at our resources as something to be shared, we can turn waste into something useful and beneficial. 

The Singapore Green Plan 2030 aims to reduce waste to landfill per capita by 20%. We can work towards that goal with small actions on an individual scale. If you have a surplus of what you need, share it! It may end up being useful to someone else.""

However, I was still keen to get vaccinated to be protected from COVID-19.

I was hoping to be eligible despite taking medication for high blood pressure and high cholesterol for the past 10 years. I also had 2nd stage Thymoma cancer but it is now in remission.

With that in mind, I thought that I should go to the vaccination centre to check with the nurse. After I went, they asked me if I had breathlessness when the allergy was triggered. I said no I didn’t, so they said ok, I can go for it.

After the jabs, I had some mild side effects – an arm ache for a couple of days. But everything has settled and I feel fine now.

No matter if you’re young or old, it’s still better to get vaccinated. We don’t know when this virus will hit us, maybe even from the person closest to you.

"“I’ve had kidney problems since 2017. There was nothing much else the doctor could do. I remember he said, ‘Your kidneys – gone already’. Now I go for dialysis three times a week at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) centre.

I’m also diabetic and I take my insulin medication twice a day – once in the morning, once at night. 

Despite my medical conditions, I took the second dose of my COVID-19 vaccination about 3 weeks ago. It was ok, just a small pinch when the nurse injected me. 

Before going, I asked my kidney doctor at the NKF whether I should go. She knows my medical reports and history, and she said, ‘If you feel ok, you should go’. 

When I was at the vaccination centre, the doctors checked again. They asked me ‘Everything ok, no allergy?’ I went through screening and they said I could take it. 

Some people talk about getting fever from the vaccine. I tell my friends, ‘Don’t be scared, you can take a Panadol to feel better.’ It’s been good so far, I don’t have much problems. 

Whenever my friends and I catch up at the kopitiam, we’d say, “since the Government give you free (vaccination), better go! Protect yourself”!

"“I started Daily Green™ by chance. I used to frequent this vegetarian stall after my religious studies and the stall owner wanted to give up his shop. He asked if I wanted to take over the stall and I decided to take the plunge.

I was an optician for 8 years but wasn’t satisfied with the 9 to 5 daily grind. When the opportunity came to take over the vegetarian stall, I decided to take my love for cooking seriously. I was already a vegetarian by then and knew how to cook some dishes. 

Green Monday invited me to tour their factory. They are a social impact company that advocates for a plant-based diet, owning brands such as OmniMeat, etc, that use food tech to create a range of alternative protein food products. My wish for a better, liveable planet coincided with their purposeful fight against climate change and planetary devastation. They also wanted to champion a plant-based diet, which is something I wanted to do. It was clear that we had the same values, which was why I decided to partner with them. 

Many traditional vegetarian food stalls use gluten as a base, but OmniMeat uses plant-based ingredients. I observed that the younger generation in Singapore are also more concerned with health and the climate, and wanted to take the chance to introduce healthier alternatives to them.

We’re constantly experimenting with our menu – coming up with new items regularly, from satay bee hoon to laksa to even “pork” curry rice.

It was really challenging in the beginning. I had no experience as an entrepreneur and a stall owner. I’d moved from a comfortable office environment into a hot and sweaty kitchen. I was also barely making enough money to sustain the business for the first 7 months and had to take a further loan from the bank to keep the business running. I persevered and the business managed to pick up after that. 

Daily Green™’s long-term vision is to promote healthy and delicious vegetarian food, as well as to play our part in protecting the earth. My wish is for more people to try vegetarian food. It can just be once a week, but I believe that it would help the environment in the long run.”

"“Most of us born post-independence never struggled with putting food on the table as Singapore is an affordable food haven. Where else can you get a $3.00 hot meal in a first world country? Because of this, some of us do not think twice about dumping food. 

But a significant portion of Singaporeans still experience food insecurity despite being in a food-secure nation. Hunger still exists in Singapore. 

That’s why my brother and I started Food Bank Singapore in 2012.

Being in the food distribution industry, we realised that Singapore generates a tremendous amount of food waste - 744 million kg of food waste in 2019 – that’s the weight of 3,230 MRT trains.

Tackling food waste and food insecurity was not easy. Things became tougher when COVID-19 hit. Even so, we managed to redistribute more than 1.6 million kg of food last year. Even with a full-time team of just 10, we could make things work by being innovative and creative.

I see the Singapore Green Plan 2030 as a means for us and other organisations to push ahead boldly with sustainability ideas. The plan has given our country something even more concrete to work towards beyond just growing the GDP numbers. 

Going green and sustainable starts with baby steps. No step is too small to take as long as it is in the right direction.

Being sustainable will no longer be by the way. It will soon be the only way.”

Because of my heart condition, before I went for the vaccination, I checked with the doctor at the polyclinic to ask if it was suitable for me. He assured me that it is suitable, and encouraged me to go for it. With that, I asked my daughter to help me to register for the vaccination.

I did my injections at the Community Club. The wait took about 5 to 10 minutes, and then after taking the jab, I waited half an hour to make sure everything was ok. I didn’t have noticeable side effects after the jabs.

Vaccination is important because I want to continue to be active. Every morning, I do a little exercise, then I go to the market to get food and groceries. I also want to be healthy enough to look after my 11-month-old grandson.

Because of my medical conditions, I think it’s even more important that I take the COVID-19 vaccination. I want to protect myself.”

I had worked for an events company for 10 years as a photographer and videographer, covering mostly weddings. I never thought that the wedding industry would be affected, but that’s COVID-19 for you. 

I left my job in March 2020.

Thankfully, I benefitted from the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme which provided some temporary financial relief.

While at home, I tried some online courses. Having studied animation before, I wanted to get up to speed in motion graphics to enter the animation industry. But I lacked the motivation and discipline, and the course wasn’t structured, so that didn’t work.

My brother then suggested I look into User Experience, or UX. It was related to graphic design, which I did a fair bit of in my events job. Without any prior knowledge of UX, I signed up for a 6-month UX Design and Product Management course at NTU.

I really enjoyed the course since I started in Jan this year. We used design skills to solve problems and make it easier for people to navigate websites. Of course, having a training allowance of $1,200 a month was also a bonus.

It was an intensive course, with several Zoom meetings a week, and almost daily project meetings and assignments. I’m hopeful that when I graduate in July, I’ll get a UX job. I see myself doing this in the long run.""

"“Beach cleanups are very tiring. But I want to do something while I still can.

I’m a team IC of SG Beach Warriors. Though I’m already 71, being part of the SG Beach Warriors team allows me to stay active and play a part in protecting the environment – a win-win situation!

I first met Faith, the organiser of SG Beach Warriors, during a hike. She introduced me to the idea of beach cleanups & its positive impact on the environment. It helps prevent wildlife like birds from getting entangled with rubbish like plastic bags, nets, and lines, etc., & even make it possible for sightings of turtles when they return to shore to lay their eggs – something that is rarely appreciated in Singapore. She helped me realise that sustainability is more than just reusing and recycling things. With the advancement of technology, the scale of sustainability has gotten much bigger.

Beach cleanups are just a small part of sustainability. It’s the mindset that matters the most. Right now, I feel that sustainability is just a buzzword for many people. People have a higher standard of living now, and they have the habit of throwing things away so that they can buy a new one. There will be no improvement if people keep throwing things away, because we’ll just be cleaning up what they have just thrown.

We may not be able to achieve much with the efforts of one person, but there is strength in numbers. When the SG Beach Warriors are out together, we attract more attention. There are even times when people would join us! The SG Green Plan is a really good initiative in my opinion. Planting more trees and fostering a mangrove ecosystem around the coastal area will be beneficial for the future of Singapore and the younger generation of Singaporeans.

I hope to one day attend a beach cleanup and realise that there is less trash to clear. And hopefully, inspire others through my actions. It’s important for us to protect the sea and marine life, and upkeep Singapore’s reputation as a beautiful garden city.”

"“The pandemic made me realise that many of us don’t really know our neighbours. My grandma couldn’t buy her groceries like she usually did because we couldn’t be there to help her, and so I thought, ‘what if her neighbours (or the community) could come together to help each other?’

I came up with the idea for the Scratchbac app because I believe there is real benefit from knowing our neighbours and the people around us. I called it Scratchbac after the phrase: ‘you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.’ 

It was tough trying to get Scratchbac going because I had to juggle my studies at the same time. Plus, I didn’t have all the skills. Thankfully, I had a team who believed in the app. We had to figure what we needed for the app, study it, and then apply what we learnt to develop the app. 

We wanted to use technology to help people reconnect on a hyperlocal level, or to put it simply, on a small and defined area (e.g. just 1 to 2km away from you). That’s because we have a lot more resources when we are connected. We’re already seeing how people are helping each other through the app, like someone managing to borrow a walking cane, or even enrolling for a course together to get a discount. It’s also heart-warming to see that there are even people using the app to link up with like-minded individuals to jog and hike.

With the ongoing pandemic, the community can come together to provide a helping hand to those facing hardships, just like the days of living in kampungs. As we move forward as a society, I hope that Singaporeans can be kinder and more understanding, and Scratchbac app can be a part of that solution.”

"“Everything was going well until the pandemic happened. I thought it would only last a short while, but the months dragged on and it was getting tough to cope.

I was running cooking classes for tourists and a successful bicycle tour business ‘Let’s Go Tour Singapore’ with my business partner. We started it after being inspired by other bicycle tours we participated in during our travels and came up with the idea of a tour called: ’Trails of Tan Ah Huat: Singapore 1920s’. The idea was a hit with tourists in Singapore, and we even won the Best Tour Experience in 2019! 

When COVID-19 struck, we had zero income for many months, but there were still expenses and overheads to be taken care of. I had to find a way to make it work.

Instead of scaling down, we decided to band together with other like-minded tour guides and tap on each other’s resources. We had to make many changes to our programmes to pivot to local tourism. This meant finding hidden gems around the island to appeal to the local crowd and adapting the cooking classes to suit the local taste, such as introducing authentic Hainanese cuisine. 

Things are looking much better today. We used to only conduct 10 cooking classes a month for tourists, but now we have around 30 classes a month for local visitors. We’re also making plans for when tourists return to Singapore – like working on possible partnerships with overseas tour agencies and developing new programmes. 

I’m thankful for how Singapore responded to the pandemic. The various government schemes really helped to keep the tourism industry afloat.

Throughout this period, I’ve learnt never to take things for granted and to go with the flow. When caught in a difficult situation, we must keep working, keep adapting. Only then would we survive and thrive.”

"“I wasn’t sure what sustainability entailed until I entered Junior College. After researching more about the global climate, I realised that the situation was dire, and the effects were escalating in an unequal way across different communities around the world. 

This made me think about what I could do for sustainability. 

I started eating more plant-based foods instead of animal products. I also created two Instagram accounts (@consciouscookieee & @consciousmochiii) on plant-based food to raise awareness on environmental issues. 

While studying in university, I led a group called the “Vision of Equality for a Greener Earth” or in short VEGE, as there weren’t many students who knew about the concept of a plant-based lifestyle. 

Under VEGE, my teammates and I started a “Meat-Lite Movement”, where we worked closely with the university’s canteen stall owners and other major campus stakeholders to bring more plant-based options to F&B establishments around the campus. 

Even though the journey was not easy, I am heartened that the tide may be changing, with more and more plant-based options being launched across Singapore.

At a broader level, I hope to see more reskilling programmes or initiatives to help those interested to move into green industries, such as those producing plant-based food and more sustainable energy, to support the Singapore Green Plan 2030’s sustainability goals.”

"""Insectta was founded on the belief that disposal is not the end of a product’s life. At our farm, Black Soldier Fly larvae and innovative technologies are used to convert food waste into biomaterials, which can then be used in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. These tiny bugs have an amazing recycling ability!

At a very young age, I was taught the importance of prolonging the life of products. This was largely influenced by my grandfather’s work as a karang guni (rag and bone) man. I’ve grown up believing that there is no such thing as “waste” – only wasteful ways of producing.

We know many are still hesitant about the industrial use of insects. Part of our mission is to change this misperception. These harmless insects are different from typical pests. Unlike cockroaches or rodents, Black Soldier Flies don’t thrive in urban conditions and will most likely die outside of controlled conditions. There is really very little cause for concern about the risk of infestation.

As this industry is still relatively new, we have been working closely with the government to develop this industry for the benefit of our environment and the economy. This is our way of supporting the SG Green Plan. 

I’m optimistic that more people will shift towards a circular economy mindset, instead of seeing a linear lifecycle of products. This is crucial to change the way we make everyday decisions that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. As we often say at Insectta, “the only way forward is to soldier on!”

At a very young age, I was taught the importance of prolonging the life of products. This was largely influenced by my grandfathers work as akarang guni(rag and bone) man. Ive grown up believing that there is no such thing as waste  only wasteful ways of producing.

We know many are still hesitant about the industrial use of insects. Part of our mission is to change this misperception. These harmless insects are different from typical pests. Unlike cockroaches or rodents, Black Soldier Flies dont thrive in urban conditions and will most likely die outside of controlled conditions. There is really very little cause for concern about the risk of infestation.

As this industry is still relatively new, we have been working closely with the government to develop this industry for the benefit of our environment and the economy. This is our way of supporting the SG Green Plan.

Im optimistic that more people will shift towards a circular economy mindset, instead of seeing a linear lifecycle of products. This is crucial to change the way we make everyday decisions that are more sustainable and environmentally friendly. As we often say at Insectta, the only way forward is to soldier on!

"(1/2) “Why can’t there be wheelchair accessible paths on Google Maps for wheelchair users?”

“This question came to mind after an incident in 2012. My colleagues and I were walking from Citylink to Marina Square and there was an escalator linking the two malls. However, one of my colleagues, who is a wheelchair user, could not take the escalator. We tried to find an accessible path for him, but we could not find any. In the end, we ran across the road with him. It was dangerous, but we did not have a choice. 

That motivated me to start SmartBFA (Smart Barrier-Free Access), a smart solution that aims to find barrier-free access routes for wheelchair users through crowdsourced sensor data, in 2018. During the initial phase of the project, custom sensor devices were placed on the wheelchairs of volunteers to collect accessibility data as they went about their daily commute. 

As the project evolved, we did away with the sensor devices and developed a mobile application to allow our volunteers to easily collect accessibility data and annotate obstacles - such as steep slopes, unsheltered pathways and narrow pathways. The data collected was processed and translated onto a map for use by wheelchair users or their caregivers. 

With these enhanced features, I hope to empower individuals using wheelchairs, and encourage them to commute with ease and confidence. We managed to obtain partial funding for this project from Tote Board’s Enabling Lives Initiative Grant, and we are supported by SG Enable. 

I believe that in order for us to build an inclusive society, we need to create greater awareness and empathy about those who are different from us. In Singapore, many of us are generally not aware of the needs of persons with disabilities. So, it is not just about one specific group, but all disability groups.”

"(2/2) “I’m always advocating for road accessibility for wheelchair users. Ever since I started using a wheelchair after a side effect from a chemotherapy treatment I received at the age of 17, I’ve been searching for ways that will help me travel in public places with ease. Unlike non-wheelchair users, I’d usually have to take a longer route as I need to find ramps. If I’m unfamiliar with the area, I won’t know where the accessibility paths are. 

In the past, when I needed to go to a certain public place, I would check Google Maps and use street view to study my route. The map allowed me to zoom in to see if there were any kerbs or steps that I could clear. If I couldn’t, I would have to find an alternative route. 

SmartBFA, a mobile app that maps accessibility routes, has been a great help when planning my outings. It notifies me of the potential obstacles along the way, and even the angle of the ramp. I was very excited when I learned about SmartBFA and quickly signed up to be a volunteer. 

Singapore has improved its infrastructure in terms of accessibility over the years, but there is still room for improvement. It’s not just about having ramps but also the type of ramps that are suitable for wheelchair users when going up and down. There needs to be a deeper understanding and awareness of specific needs of those with disabilities when building infrastructure, instead of considering it an after-thought. Only then can we truly be an inclusive society.”

"“You don’t have to be told you are losing your job to know it’s coming. As an operations controller at Scoot, the signs were all there.

I loved my job. I was in-charge of daily flight and crew operations. I was previously in the finance industry before I left, out of passion, to join the aviation industry in 2017.

Instead of stubbornly sticking to my chosen path, I knew I had to tweak my mindset and seek other opportunities. 

While still at Scoot, I started evaluating about the next best sector for me. I’ve sent out resumes for operational roles, as well as roles in the education industry - something I had an interest in.

The axe fell in September 2020. I was retrenched. 

But while it was daunting, I now had a better idea of how to boost my chances of getting a job.

For instance, I didn’t just list skills like “communication” or “operations” on my resume. I supported it with details of past projects and accomplishments which demonstrated those skills. 

I’ve customised nearly 100 resumes, to the needs of each organization. An e2i career coach by the name of Theresa, lived by her profession and helped me make them stand out from the rest. 

The effort paid off and I had four job offers by end October 2020. Theresa provided valuable advice which helped me narrow the list and in November, I scored my current job.

Of course, once you get the job, getting used to a new culture is another aspect of pivoting! 

But being adaptable and able to take on new challenges are invaluable skills I’ve gained.”

"“The first year was particularly tough for me when COVID hit. My son was born just before Circuit Breaker and I was struggling to transit to fatherhood and coping with working from home. I noticed I wasn’t the only one having trouble adjusting. There were a lot of social needs emerging due to the restrictive nature of Circuit Breaker — from migrant workers needing essentials, to healthcare workers requiring better tools to communicate with their patients. 

Since I had a background in creating online digital solutions, I thought this would be a good way I could help contribute. I knew there was quite a bit of confusion when the safe management measures were announced and adjusted accordingly with the local situation. I quickly created Safedistancing.sg so that people could get all the information from one place. With no-code tools, I was able to get it out in just 2 or 3 days. The website went viral with a few thousand visitors on launch day. It was also very encouraging to get messages about how the website was really useful. After that, it was just getting feedback and continuing to refine the product. 

I also created a community board called – ‘Dabao Dash’ – for hawkers and independent F&B shops to connect with delivery drivers, so that they could get their food delivered without hefty costs. I could see that many of these F&B shops were being hit hard by the pandemic, I just wanted to do my part to protect our culinary legacy before they are gone for good. It was important to quickly get these digital solutions out, so I spread the word via my personal network, social media platforms, and even on Telegram/WhatsApp chat groups. 

We have shown that we can be very resourceful in times of a crisis. With the wide variety of no-code tools, you don’t need prior programming knowledge. We can all do our part, even if it’s through simple ways like starting Facebook/Telegram groups and using Google Sheets. With these tools, we may be helping a lot more people than we think.”

"“People like to say ‘go virtual’ like it’s an easy thing. But let me tell you - it’s not that easy to do. 

I’ve been a live-events emcee and planner for over 30 years. What I like most about the job is the energy from the audience that fuels me when I am on stage. The music, the lights, the laughter and the applause. I haven’t had any of that since February 2020 when all the jobs dried up.

The first chance I had to go virtual was when a client whom I had worked with for years called me to manage and host a virtual event for them in October 2020. 

Easy? Nothing is easy. I realised that the amount of prep work needed to produce a successful virtual event, is just as much as a physical event.

It involved live-video streaming from 17 countries. We really didn’t know what to expect. We were operating out of a makeshift studio with minimal IT equipment. We faced huge technical difficulties, connection issues and co-ordination challenges in countries where the first language was not English. We got through by the skin of our teeth. But on that job, I learnt so much.

With that experience as a showcase of sorts, I managed and hosted several more virtual events. Each one gets easier and more enjoyable.

The foundation of a virtual event is the technology, so organisers really need to work with very strong tech partners. I partner a company called Odyssey Concepts, which uses a state-of-the-art green-screen studio to cater to the virtual events market.

I still miss the energy from a live audience. But this is the new reality. And I take comfort that even though I cannot see them, they send me comments after the show to say that they really enjoyed what I did! At the end of the day, all I want to do is entertain, even if it’s through a screen.”

"“I’m actually not surprised that I had gotten the virus, but I do understand that with the vaccination, I will be in a safe state. For most (fully vaccinated) people – about 98% will recover with mild or no symptoms. For them, the Home Recovery Programme would be ideal. 

 I was able to work from home, connect with my co-workers, and also spend a lot more time having “me time”, doing things that I like. 

I’m feeling as good as before. If you are eligible for the vaccine, I would recommend to take it as soon as possible to build a defense against the virus. Even if you’re vaccinated, I would suggest you to avoid crowded places, practice social distancing and step up on your personal hygiene. Protect yourself and your loved ones.”

"“In my seven years volunteering at the Thekchen Choling temple, last year’s Vesak Day celebrations was the biggest hurdle we had to overcome. The Circuit Breaker period caught us all off guard as we had to ensure that the celebrations could continue safely and plan for a virtual event. 

Thankfully, the temple had already started minor upgrades to its IT systems around 4 years ago and we invested in buying new AV equipment. We also revamped our website which allowed for online registration for events. You could say it was good timing as that system had only been running for just 6 months before the Circuit Breaker period!

Various messaging platforms were also used to broadcast important announcements for the event. As many of our devotees are seniors, we made sure they received help to register for the event via our telephone helpline. 

Our nuns, monks and volunteers all banded together to make sure the event ran smoothly. After the event, some of our senior nuns started to broadcast daily prayers live and continued to use the direct messaging platforms to stay connected with our devotees. 

Many devotees still miss the physical connection of being in the temple. We plan to increase the temple floor space to accommodate more devotees while maintaining safe distancing and have made further improvements to our IT infrastructure. 

While we hope to eventually be able to welcome our devotees back to the temple, we know that the situation is unpredictable and are ready to pivot our operations to the online space. 

From this experience, I’ve learnt that we need to be mindful of the different age groups when making the transition to digital platforms. It is easy to assume that everyone is savvy enough to follow, but that is never always the case. We must keep a look out for those who may have difficulties and go the extra mile to help them. This is what it means to be stronger together.”

“Sadly, many parents fail to understand that young people can suffer from mental health issues. They don’t realise that society has changed tremendously. So in 2019, a group of bereaved mothers & I started the PleaseStay.Movement to raise awareness of youth suicide & share about the loss we suffered. 
 
When COVID-19 hit in 2020, we had youths reaching out to us for help through FB. A couple of teenagers shared with us that they felt life was no longer worth living. We offered them words of comfort & directed them to seek professional help. These cases may seem extreme, but they spoke volumes on how the pandemic had a huge impact on mental health.
 
Young people are becoming more conscious of how they present themselves due to their exposure to social media. Similarly, the peer pressure they experience is much stronger than what we used to face. I remember once when my child didn’t do well in his exam, he cried because he felt he wasn’t good enough. I told him that I didn’t compare him with other children & that I was content so long as he did his best. Despite this assurance, the tragedy still happened because he couldn’t come to terms with his academic performance & societal pressures. I believe this is something parents need to be mindful of as we live in a rapidly changing society. They may need to relook at their parenting skills & show more empathy so that they can communicate with their children effectively.
 
As a community, we need to be more empathetic, & play a part to show love & care for the people around us. We’ve heard stories of how certain actions can drive a person to suicide. Sometimes, all anyone needs is just a hug or pat on the shoulder when they going through tough times. If you encounter someone looking like they are not their usual self, just ask them how they are feeling. Little things like that lets them know there is someone who cares for them.”

"“I’ve been in HR for most of my professional life. 

My career trajectory took a detour when I left my HR job in 2019 to move to China for 6 months with my family. We wanted to spend quality time before my son started formal primary education, experience a different culture, and also improve my Mandarin.

It wasn’t an easy decision. I was concerned about our finances, my career, and if I could find a suitable job when we returned. My hands trembled when I handed in my resignation letter.

In China, I doubled down on networking efforts via online platforms. I took up online courses and volunteered with professional HR bodies.

It made all the difference when I returned. The CEO of an education technology company whom I knew contacted me about a HR leadership advisory role. But he also wanted me to head up digital marketing efforts.

This was completely new for me. I went for a Professional Conversion Programme with QED Consulting where I learnt about SEO, analytics, and using digital channels to create brand awareness.

I realised how important networking is in one’s career. Nurture networks early, even before we need it. 

Learning is lifelong. You can pivot to other roles, even at a late age. 

You are always in control of your career.”

"“My passion is in using technology to create innovative experiences for our community, including improving the lives of our elderly. That was why I started Dude Studio in 2010, a creative tech studio that has been evolving nearly every year with our most recent focus being developing Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) experiences. Building never seen before stuff excites me. 

In 2017, I developed a VR racing game for wheelchair-bound patients to have fun and to keep their minds active. A specially designed wheelchair is hooked up with sensors, so that the patient can navigate the VR game by turning the wheels. It took me close to five months to perfect the game.

Just a while before that, my friend suggested we bring my VR goggles to NTUC Health nursing home to engage the elderly residents there. The goggles transported viewers to a “virtual universe” via pre-recorded 360° videos, and they can look around by turning their heads. It was a hit with the residents and became the inspiration for me to start Mind Palace – a not-for-profit social enterprise that uses customised VR technology to help dementia patients recall memories by immersing them in familiar places as a form of reminiscence therapy.

This month, we’ve completed a boxing game which was first developed as an Instagram filter as a proof of concept. After a period of trial and error – it finally worked. It’s currently deployed at 2 of NTUC Health’s elder care facilities. However, due to safe distancing measures, we can’t be there to personally witness the Ah Gongs and Ah Mas playing our fitness game. We can only rely on the staff at the centres to send us videos of them playing the game.

I believe that digitalisation can empower the next generation to build projects in the digital space, especially for countries like Singapore where physical space can be an issue. I hope to continue creating innovative technologies that can help improve the lives of the elderly in our society.”

"""Food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore. While a lot of work has been done to recycle and redistribute food, very few initiatives work towards preventing food waste to begin with.

I started Lumitics to help kitchens better manage their food waste. Very early on, I noticed that many kitchens, especially commercial ones, didn’t track what was being thrown out. How can you begin to effectively reduce waste without first knowing how much waste you generate? 

At Lumitics, we decided to focus on helping hotels and airlines, as the scale of their operations would allow us make a more substantial impact. Together with a team of expert engineers, we designed and built our Insight food waste tracker from scratch. It uses a proprietary AI image recognition technology to accurately identify trash content. The data helps owners and kitchen staff understand what and how much is being thrown out, so that they can take steps to cut wastage and save costs.

It is very rewarding to see our clients make significant progress in reducing their waste generation – some close to 40%! But we also owe a debt of gratitude to these clients, who have been supportive of Lumitics’ journey thus far. They provided constructive feedback which helped us to improve the design and efficacy of the Insight tracker. In many ways, our clients gave us the room to test our technology and fail many times too!

"“I started the social enterprise ‘Happiness Initiative’ after noticing a gap in the preventive approaches towards mental health conditions in Singapore. I was fascinated about happiness & wellbeing, which prompted me to pursue further studies in the US that focused on life fulfilment & satisfaction. 

When we first introduced wellbeing programmes to schools in 2017, it wasn’t easy. The education landscape wasn’t ready. But in 2019, through a grant we received from the National Youth Council, we managed to raise awareness of the issue through a more entertaining medium – film. That was how the Happiness Film Festival started. It was well-received. Tickets were sold out. People were willing to come onboard as panellists to discuss matters that were close to their hearts. 

When the pandemic hit us in early 2020, mental health issues were pushed to the forefront. People were worried about their livelihoods. Socialising became a challenge as we were confined at home. That was when we noticed schools beginning to take a more proactive approach towards mental health. 

We organised the Happiness Film Festival again in 2021, with a focus on six vulnerable groups — the elderly, people with intellectual disabilities, youth, underprivileged families, ex-offenders, & migrant workers. It was during a time when our migrant workers were not able to leave their dormitories due to the pandemic. Through film, the community started talking about these workers & their sacrifices, which encouraged a greater understanding of what they were facing.

The UN’s World Happiness Report says Singapore has done well, but I believe there is still room for us to grow into a happier nation. We need to know what really drives us, & our sense of meaning and purpose. Other than spending time on our individual successes, how can we collectively take care of our community? 

I hope the Happiness Initiative will ensure wellbeing skills are accessible to everyone. When we look beyond ourselves and take care of people who are less fortunate than us, it will give us a greater sense of purpose.” #SGPerspectives

"“All three generations of my family live under one roof. I believe that multi-generational relationships must be nurtured early. To encourage my children to bond with their grandparents, I ask them to play in my parent’s room. That has created many conversations for them and opportunities to interact. If our family is out shopping, we encourage our kids to think of their grandparent’s favourite food to buy back home for them! 

While the circuit breaker period in 2020 was a trying period being confined at home, it didn’t stop us from bonding. Instead, we found things to do indoors, such as teaching the children how to grow plants. The kids, in turn, passed on their new-found skills to their grandparents.

One of my biggest parenting struggles is the difference in views between their grandparents and myself. However, they know that my wife and I are the ones who make the final decision. When we leave the children under our parents’ charge, we trust them to do what we agreed upon. For example, not buying them snacks or not letting them watch TV for more than two hours. We also remind our children of their boundaries, so that it’s a shared responsibility.

I'm an advocate of filial piety and regularly share about my views on promoting positive family relationships. Aside from writing, I also love photography and I’m currently busy with my next photo book  project. Titled ‘Grandparents, Cherish Them When They Are Still Around’, the photo book captures sentimental moments of my children growing up with their grandparents. It's my contribution to a St Luke’s Hospital fundraising campaign to celebrate positive ageing and provide support for their beneficiaries. 

Having a strong family can be the support that helps us overcome a crisis and reminds us that there will always be someone behind us. There are few things that truly matter in life and family is one of them.”

Ramadan is the month of the Holy Quran. Muslims fast during Ramadan. They are encouraged to do more good deeds, read the Quran and reflect on the values that it teaches.

The last 10 nights of Ramadan are especially significant for Muslims. Laylatul Qadr or the Night of Power is known to occur during this period. It is a night where past sins are erased and blessings are bountiful.

Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is meant to cultivate spiritual discipline. It cleanses one’s soul and instils compassion towards others. By feeling hungry and thirsty, it’s easier to emphatise with the poor and the needy.

Wishing all our Muslim friends, Selamat Berpuasa! 🕌

Well, everything that wakes must also sleep ☺️ Plus there are many health benefits to a good night’s sleep of at least 7-9 hours (or even longer for babies and cats)🌟
.
Here are some 💤 tips
.
#1 - Put your phones away before you sleep. Netflix and Tumblr will be there in the morning ⏰
.
#2 - If you get a caffeine high, don’t drink coffee or tea at night! Bubble tea included ☕️🍵
.
#3 - Have a routine of going to bed at consistent times, even if you don’t have to wake up as early the next day 😝

Oranges symbolise good luck. In Chinese, the character for these oranges (橘) sounds similar to the character meaning ‘auspicious’ (吉)!

.
Also called the Great Day of Sacrifice, this is one of the holiest and greater of the two Hari Raya events in the Muslim calendar. Muslims in Singapore start the celebration by visiting the mosque in the morning, followed by paying respect at homes of elderly family members. Some Muslims also distribute sacrificed livestock such as sheep and lambs to those who are less fortunate.

Here's wishing a blessed and meaningful Hari Raya Haji to all our Muslim friends!

.
Also called the Great Day of Sacrifice, this is one of the holiest and greater of the two Hari Raya events in the Muslim calendar. Muslims in Singapore start the celebration by visiting the mosque in the morning, followed by paying respect at homes of elderly family members. Some Muslims also distribute sacrificed livestock such as sheep and lambs to those who are less fortunate.
.
Here's wishing a blessed and meaningful Hari Raya Haji to all our Muslim friends!

"Once in a blue moon…hey, that means tonight! 😄 Lift your eyes to the skies this evening to see three lunar phenomena coincide! 🤩
.
One, a total lunar eclipse (where the Earth completely blocks the Sun’s rays from lighting up the moon);
.
two, a supermoon (when the moon is as close to Earth as it’ll ever be);
.
and three, a blue moon (the second full moon in a calendar month)!
.
The last time this happened in 1866, the telephone still wasn’t invented yet! But today, you can take a selfie with this rare celestial event.

"Kusu Island is one of Singapore's offshore Southern islands that you can explore by boat. It is located about 5.6 kilometres to the south of mainland Singapore.
.
Legend has it that a turtle transformed itself into the island to save two shipwrecked sailors - a Malay man and a Chinese man. That's how the island got its name because ""Kusu"" is ""Turtle"" or ""Tortoise"" in Chinese!
.
Every year, the Taoists will embark on a pilgrimage during the ninth month of the lunar calendar. The annual pilgrimage for this year began on Oct 20 and will end on Nov 17. The serene island also houses not one, but three Muslim 'keramat' (‘shrine’ in Malay). Many devotees will climb the 152 steps leading to the shrines to pray for wealth, health, harmony, good marriage, even children (for the childless couples).
.
So if you need a quick getaway from the city, why not visit Kusu Island?
